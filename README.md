# Weight Converter
A small application created with vanilla JS and Bootstrap to convert between grams, pounds and ounces. Outputs are rounded to 1dp.

Inspired by Traversy Media's "Simple Weight Converter App" tutorial, I took it a step further and introduced the ability for the user to choose the input unit via a drop-down box. Event listeners ensure the conversion values update whenever the input value or unit selection changes.

The app is hosted on GitHub Pages and can be accessed here: **https://ksells99.github.io/weight-converter/**
